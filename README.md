# Digital-Privacy-Basics

In the first part of the workshop we will discuss different aspects of digital privacy. We will take a look at the daily things of today's connected life, from search engines to messenger apps to email traffic, and look at who collects what data, where, how and for what purpose. In the second part of the workshop we will playfully explore how mobile phones track our position and use the Geneva as our drawing canvas.
